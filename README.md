# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.  I use these over multiple platforms and machines.

## Installation

### The Windows install_win.bat script is broken!

I have tested the installation on my computers only.  There are no guarantees that this will work on your system.

1. `git clone https://github.com/bigjay517/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
3. `./install_unix.sh`

## Usage

Use the dotfiles!

## Contributing

If you have any ideas for improvement feel free to contribute!

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
